# Predicting accelerometer rotations using a ML approach on sensors data

## Requirements: Windows operating system, Python

# Steps to do:
1. Open Jupyter notebook
2. Import the librairies and Execute all the functions in sens-orient.ipynb notebook ( From the beginning of the notebook till the last function: train_and_test_model_Z ).
2. Download the reports folder.
3. Change the location variable in the sens-orient.ipynb notebook and set it accordingly: It is the location of the txt files inside the folder. Please change all '\\' into '/'.
5. Execute the rest of the jupyternotebook
6. df_X, df_y and df_Z are the randomely rotated dataframes for all players on X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis respectively.
7. The Output of model_X, model_Y and model_Z are the coefficient of determination and the Mean Squared Error respectively.
